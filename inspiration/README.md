from tiktok:
real time ai coaching for basically anything

Update:

I'm open-sourcing this.

My DMs have exploded with investors, pro players, teams, users. The demo has 5,000,000 views across platforms.

There is obviously interest.

But, I have zero interest in working on it. I'm more interested in working on Tidbit.

So -- someone please steal it and run.

There's a beautiful vision here, especially those who want to build in education.

Imagine an AI super-coach in your pocket:

- Do yoga, correct your form in real-time
- Practice guitar, fix finger positioning instantly
- Learn cooking, get real-time tips on spices.
- Learn painting, get brush stroke feedback.

The future of learning will look a lot like real-time, in the moment AI instruction -- it likely won't look like an AI homework helper.

Anyways.

There's a cool vision here for the right person to obsess over for 10+ years.

And the starting point is clear -- pick one thing (ex. basketball), be the best AI real-time coach in the world for it, keep growing.

GLHF :).

P.S: The repo is literally just a visualizer file + prompt. But hey, maybe it inspires someone.

prompt
This is me playing basketball slowed down. Tell me how many shots I made tell me how many lay ups I made tell me how many three-pointers I made tell me how many shots I missed and tell me from where I made shots as well and tell me the steps on
which made the shot and missed the shot
On every shot. Give me feedback like you're Michael Jordan.

Hi this is the code from [this](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/1928484483076087922) viral demo.

Please read `ball.json`. That's where the magic is. `ball.py` is mostly just an OpenCV visualizer.

To make this a real time product you'll need to:

1) Smartly send frames to Gemini (Gemini Video can only handle 1 FPS)
2) Use Gemini API to return content.
3) Render it.

This would make a killer iOS app.

Good luck.from tiktok:
